## Homeworks and Projects

This repo contains the works that I'd done during my studies at Boğaziçi University. 

### Whale Identification Challenge ([link](./Biometrics_term_project))
* A whale classifier algorithm which is able to identify 300+ humpback whales by the photos of their tails only.
* Placed top 12\% in public leaderboard of the related Kaggle competition.

### Texture Classification using Feature Correlations ([link](./texture_classification_using_deep_learning))
* Inspired by the Neural Style Transfer algorithm, I implemented a texture classifier CNN which utilizes feature correlations of pre-trained VGG net.
* It demonstrates the effectiveness of CNN feature correlations in defining textures.

### Monte Carlo methods homeworks

* **hw1:** find _&pi;_ by rejection sampling 
* **hw2:** image denoising using Ising model Gibbs Sampler ([link](./monte_carlo-assignment2/assignment2.ipynb))
