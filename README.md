### Homeworks and Projects

This repo contains the works that I'd done during my studies at Boğaziçi University. 

## Whale Identification Challenge
* A whale classifier algorithm which is able to identify 300+ humpback whales by the photos of their tails only.
* Placed top 12\% in public leaderboard of the related Kaggle competition.

## Texture Classification using Feature Correlations
* Inspired by the Neural Style Transfer algorithm, I implemented a texture classification Convolutional Neural Net which utilizes feature correlations of pre-trained VGG net.
* It demonstrates the effectiveness of CNN feature correlations in defining textures.

## Monte Carlo methods homeworks
