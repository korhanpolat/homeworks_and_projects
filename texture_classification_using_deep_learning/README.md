# Texture Classification using VGG Feature Correlations

The aim of my project is to come up with a texture classification scheme which utilizes correlations of feature activations of a pretrained CNN, as described in *Neural Style Transfer* paper of Gatys et. al.[1]. 

You can find the detailed explanations about the project in [project report](report.pdf)

## Getting Started

This method is tested on two texture datasets, *Textures under varying Illumination, Pose and Scale* (KTH-TIPS) [2]  and *Describable Textures Dataset* (DTD). You need to download at least one of them in order to test the

* [KTH-TIPS2](http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/databases/kth-tips/download.html)
* [DTD](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/dtd/)

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
